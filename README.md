# Custom-Horizontal-Scroller

This is a demonstration of how to achieve horizontal Picker with android. 
This work is derived and improved upon a library for horizontal picker.


Playing with Views and widgets to create one for your application can be very difficlut 
with little or no help available out there on internet. 

This has captured my interest and i will try to explore more and post some more open source material on how to play
with animation, 2d graphics and custom views and widgets and app widgets. 

AnyOne Having some knowledge on these topics and if want to share some with me. YOU CAN EMAIL ME AT --
